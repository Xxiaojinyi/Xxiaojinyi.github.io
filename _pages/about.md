A nice and curious human being with a passion for discovering new things! My research focuses on healthy ageing, exploring topics such as Age-Friendly Environments (AFE), ageism, long-term care (LTC), integrated care, and the implications of population ageing on retirement and pensions.In addition to my academic pursuits, Iâ€™m enthusiastically diving into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), inspired by the incredible work of Andrew Ng.

But life isnâ€™t all about research, right? ðŸ˜‚ (Although it does occupy most of my time!). Iâ€™m a die-hard fan of Liverpool FC and the Lakers! also a passionate football player âš½, hiker â›°, and camper â›º who loves exploring nature ðŸŒ². These activities keep me grounded and bring me endless joy!

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

**â€”â€”Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021â€“2030)ï¼š** This proposal was endorsed by the 73rd World Health Assembly on 3 August 2020. It was also welcomed by the UN General Assembly on 14 December 2020 (Resolution 75/131), leading to the proclamation of a UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021â€“2030). the site is in the base directory in [Decade of Healthy Ageing](https://www.who.int/initiatives/decade-of-healthy-ageing)
